Project developed on the course COMPLETE PYTHON DEVELOPER IN 2020: ZERO TO MASTERY, on UDEMY.
I used Python, some templates for html, css and js.  Also used Flask and pythonanywhere to deploy.
The form at the end sends an email to me, so I really can receive messages, and this part I did myself (with a little help from the course!).
By the way, this course is AWESOME !!
